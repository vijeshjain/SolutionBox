# Project Description:
- A Web based application which fetches top-rated answers using StackOverFlow API in a sorted format based on the relevance of the results for a user's query.
- Implemented real time analysis of the data using Google Charts of sorted/unsorted data and hottest technologies.
- Generated results by this application will be a set of most accurate results, thus time saved. 
- As StackOverFlow provides results based on either on the question's relevance or based on top voted answers filter (*NOT BOTH AT A TIME*), thus developed Solution Box to overcome this shortcoming.
- Developed an algorithm to retrieve results based on relevance + top voted answers for the user query consuming StackOverFlow API.
